Nathan Fontenot (19):
      Initial commit for the new combined powerpc-utils package from the
         previous powerpc-utils and p;owerpc-utils-papr packages.
      Ignore hotplug power-off failures when the devie tree property
         "/proc/device-tree/ibm,ignore-hp-po-fails-for-dlpar" exists.
      Return RC_ALREADY_OWN when trying to add a PHB that is already owned by
         the partition.
      There are instances where goto_dir() will incorrectly return success.  An
         updated find_dir allows us to check the result before trying to cd to
         the directory we want.
      Update the find command in get_vfc_wwpn() to handle being passed a
         symbolic link.  Previously this lead to an infinite loop due to the
         possible circular nature of sysfs.
      Change the name format for vio devices and correct indentation.
      When disabling SMT for a processor, make sure that we leave the first
         thread of the processor enabled and disable all the others.
      Remove unneeded spaces to correct previous patch for find_dir()
      Update Meta data
      The sysfs_dev_path member of the dr_node struct is a char[] and needs to
         be treated as such.  this fixes a bug where the sysfs_dev_path is
         treated as a char * and returning invalid info when the buffer is
         actually empty.
      Cpu add failures need to return 1 instead of -1.  A return code of -1
         causes the IVM to think there has been a really bad error and the IVM
         will wait 15 minutes prior to re-trying the operation.
      Logical device name to open firmware path translation for fibre-channel
         devices can fail on systems where the fc_remote_ports file in sysfs
         has a slightly different name.  On some systems this file appears as
         fc_remote_ports:rport-X:Y-Z.  This patch corrects the lookup of this
         file.
      The amsvis command will fail if vio devices have addresses greater than
         30000009 due to a problem with hexidecimal values attempting to be
         sorted as long integers.  This patch changes the sort to use string
         comparisions.
      I'm removing the __date__, __version__, and __source fields from each of
         the files.  They were filled in by CVS keyword expansion and won't be
         updated by GIT.
      s patch adds an additional output message when drmgr fails to remove all
         of the requested lmbs in a drmgr memory remove request.  This
         additional message is meant just to help clarify that the memory
         remove operations didn't fail, but was unable to completely fulfill
         the request.  This update came as a request from testers.
      When removing nodes from the device tree in /proc the recusrsive routine
         can fail with a bad pointer to the DIR struct.  The DIR struct should
         be rewound after each remove to avoid this.
      The /usr/sbin/rsct/bin/refrsrc command forces a refresh of the HMC/IVM
         and RMC status after a migration occurs.  We should do this from the
         drmgr command instead of assuming servicelog is installed.  A failure
         to invoke this command can cause additional migrations to be delayed
         for up to 10 minutes while the framework refreshes itself.
      This is really more of a re-write than an update.  The ppc64_cpu command
         is being ported from Perl to C to support new functionality.  This
         update introduces two new pieces of functionality to the command.
      This patch contains all of the additional updates needed to support the
         new version of ppc64_cpu, removal of old script and Makefile updates.
