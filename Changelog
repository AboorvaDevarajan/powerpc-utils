    This patch does a lot of cleanup of the indentation in places to use 4
    spaces instead of tabs.  Note, this is not really what is preferred but
    what is used by this script, this change tries to make indentation
    consistent in the script.
    
    This patch also makes sure that any called commands redirect their
    error messages to /dev/null and makes sure that bootlist error messages
    are written to stderr.

    The bootlist command uses the ofpathname command to convert between
    logical device names and Open Firmware device path names. The current
    use of ofpathname does not correctly interpret the output and whether
    the ofpathname call succeeds or not.
    
    This patch updates the calling of ofpathname for the entire bootlist
    script to properly handle the return values and success.

    The man page and usages statement incorrectly specify the -m option
    as the only required option. One can run the command and only specify
    the -m option, but this results in the script doing nothing.

commit 5a803bf7232929d09ecb86d8f3c32c74dfd41755
Author: Tyrel Datwyler <tyreld@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
Date:   Wed May 29 21:06:02 2013 -0500

    The say() logging function allocates a static 256 byte buffer for
    messages. Messages passed to say() larger than 256 bytes result in a
    truncated message followed by garbage from past the end of the buffer being
    written to the log file. This is a result of using the return value of
    vsnprintf as the length input to the write function. Despite only
    writing no more than 256 bytes (including the trailing \0) to the buffer
    the return value of vsnprintf is actually the total number of bytes (not
    including the trailing \0) that would have been written had the buffer
    been long enough.
    
    This patch checks for truncation, labels the end of the message
    stating as much, and corrects the message length passed to write.

    This patch changes logic around quanity requested and # sections removable
    for memory remove.  Previously, if you had requested X but some non-zero
    quantify less than X were available it would bail.  Now it will attempt
    to remove as many as are available.  For this case it is still considered
    a partial success and a non-zero (error) return code is given so that
    output is displayed on the management console.
    
    Messages for the memory remove code path are impoved and some message
    logging levels are changed.  Messages now indicate situations that are
    really bugs and should be looked at by support.  For those cases it also
    points the user to /var/log/drmgr for the debug logs.
    
    Here are output examples for the different levels:

    The drmgr command has always taken the -w option to specify
    how long to try an operation before timing out. Historically
    this option was always ignored, and then at some point used to
    time out when trying to acquire the drmgr lock.
    
    As we see larger systems coming around we need to start honoring
    this option so we do not consume unneeded time going through every
    possible LMB and CPU on the system.
    
    This patch saves the timeout specified on the command line (-w)
    and then checks it while trying to take the drmgr lock and before
    each CPU/LMB it tries to add/remove. If no timeout is specified
    then drmgr will never timeout.

    The upstream kernel has a feature in the pseries PCI code called DDW
    that inserts TCEs transparently to device drivers. The upstream kernel
    was recently sent a fix for DLPAR that ensured those TCEs would get
    cleared upon DLPAR remove (http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/213735/),
    but for it to work, we need a corresponding change to drmgr for, at
    least, PHB remove, so that the notifier chain has fired before we call
    into the slot isolate code. Without such a change, there is no way to
    ensure the DDW TCEs are cleared, and the DLPAR will always fail.

    stop the process we are attaching to while under ptrace control.

    Includes the status field for Ethernet devices.  This field is necessary for
    the End-to-End Virtual Device View feature.  The field is blindly set to 1
    because we're trying to mimic AIX's lsdevinfo behavior that always sets it t
    unless the device doesn't have a driver, which can't happen in Linux.

    There are two parameters on lparstat, count and interval, that were
    undocumented on the man page. This patch adds these parameters to the
    option section in the lparstat manpage.

    snap uses temporary directory to gather system data (files and command
    output), and finally creates compressed output file in tar or tar.gz
    format. We do not need to keep the temporary directory.
    
    This patch deletes the temprory directory used by snap.

    Currently by default snap output is stored in snap.tar.gz file. This
    makes difficult to identify when the snap output was collected.
    
    This patch introduces new option -t which adds hostname adds and
    system time to output filename. With -t output filename will be
    snap-<hostname>-<systemtime>.tar.gz. This patch also creates
    snap_commands directory inside $outdir to save output of commands
    executed by snap.

    Currently snap does not validate the directory name and output filename pass
ed
    with snap options -d and -o respectively. If we pass existing directory whic
h
    contains files/other subdirectories with -d option, while creating the outpu
t
    (snap.tar.gz) it includes all those files which is wrong. If we pass existin
g
    filename with -o option it will override existing file.
    
    This patch fixes above mentioned issue by validating input parameter
    passed to snap command.

    Restrict the unsafe constructs by using "use strict" perl pragma
    and hence make snap code better.

    Adds support for physical ethernet devices so that the HMCs end-to-end
    virtual device view can show SR-IOV VFs. Moves common virtual and physical
    ethernet code to show_eth() function
