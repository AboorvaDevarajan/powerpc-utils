    The frequency determination for a system can fail if we can not open
    enough files to make the determination. This patch pre-emptively
    updates the rlimit to ensure we can open all the files necessary.

    The latest firmware levels allow for setting different power savings
    modes. This updates the ppc64_cpu command to display the power savings
    mode that is currently set for the partition, or for the partition
    and the system if they are different, when displaying the results
    for the --frequency option.

    Add support to convert device-mapper multipath device names to OFW device pa
th.
    As multipath devices are seen by the OFW as multiple (equivalent) devices, o
nly
    one of them is printed so we don't break user scripts expecting one line
    output. We can add an option later to print all the paths to the multipath
    device.

    We have introduced full fledged Light Path Diagnostics support
    on PowerLinux. To bring all Light Path Diagnostics related
    code into common tree and re-use common functionalities across
    tools, we have re-implemented usysident/usysattn commands. Light
    Path Diagnostics including new implentation of usysident/usysattn
    will be hosted in PowerLinux diagnostic package (ppc64-diag).
    
    ppc64-diag source:
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-diag/files/ppc64-diag/
    
    This will introduce package conflict between ppc64-diag and
    powerpc-utils. To avoid the conflict we need to deprecate the
    usysident/usysattn commands from powerpc-utils.
    
    This patch deprecates usysident/usysattn commands.

    Update the values reported in the ppc64_cpu --frequency output to
    be displayed to three digits of precision instead of two.
    
    This update to help with test teams that are making this update to their
    code base already so as to get this precision in the reporting.

    The latest kernels allow for users to get/set the DSCR value on a per proces
    This allows for more refined DSCR setting in applications. This is implement
    by using the ptrace peekuser capabilites in the kernel and simply doing a
    ptrace attach and peek from the ppc64_cpu command. Note: this does not actua
    stop the process we are attaching to while under ptrace control.
    
    The patch does a little more than just adding this functionality since the
    --dscr commad now takes an optional -p <pid> option. This required an
    updated to the command parsing code to allow this.

    Includes the status field for Ethernet devices.  This field is necessary for
    the End-to-End Virtual Device View feature.  The field is blindly set to 1
    because we're trying to mimic AIX's lsdevinfo behavior that always sets it t
    unless the device doesn't have a driver, which can't happen in Linux.

    snap uses temporary directory to gather system data (files and command
    output), and finally creates compressed output file in tar or tar.gz
    format. We do not need to keep the temporary directory.
    
    This patch deletes the temprory directory used by snap.

    Currently by default snap output is stored in snap.tar.gz file. This
    makes difficult to identify when the snap output was collected.
    
    This patch introduces new option -t which adds hostname adds and
    system time to output filename. With -t output filename will be
    snap-<hostname>-<systemtime>.tar.gz. This patch also creates
    snap_commands directory inside $outdir to save output of commands
    executed by snap.

    with snap options -d and -o respectively. If we pass existing directory whic

    contains files/other subdirectories with -d option, while creating the outpu

    (snap.tar.gz) it includes all those files which is wrong. If we pass existin
g
    filename with -o option it will override existing file.
    
    This patch fixes above mentioned issue by validating input parameter
    passed to snap command.
