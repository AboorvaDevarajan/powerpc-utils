    The latest kernels allow for users to get/set the DSCR value on a per proces
    This allows for more refined DSCR setting in applications. This is implement
    by using the ptrace peekuser capabilites in the kernel and simply doing a
    ptrace attach and peek from the ppc64_cpu command. Note: this does not actua
    stop the process we are attaching to while under ptrace control.
    
    The patch does a little more than just adding this functionality since the
    --dscr commad now takes an optional -p <pid> option. This required an
    updated to the command parsing code to allow this.

    Includes the status field for Ethernet devices.  This field is necessary for
    the End-to-End Virtual Device View feature.  The field is blindly set to 1
    because we're trying to mimic AIX's lsdevinfo behavior that always sets it t
    unless the device doesn't have a driver, which can't happen in Linux.

    There are two parameters on lparstat, count and interval, that were
    undocumented on the man page. This patch adds these parameters to the
    option section in the lparstat manpage.

    snap uses temporary directory to gather system data (files and command
    output), and finally creates compressed output file in tar or tar.gz
    format. We do not need to keep the temporary directory.
    
    This patch deletes the temprory directory used by snap.

    Currently by default snap output is stored in snap.tar.gz file. This
    makes difficult to identify when the snap output was collected.
    
    This patch introduces new option -t which adds hostname adds and
    system time to output filename. With -t output filename will be
    snap-<hostname>-<systemtime>.tar.gz. This patch also creates
    snap_commands directory inside $outdir to save output of commands
    executed by snap.

    Currently snap does not validate the directory name and output filename pass
ed
    with snap options -d and -o respectively. If we pass existing directory whic
h
    contains files/other subdirectories with -d option, while creating the outpu
t
    (snap.tar.gz) it includes all those files which is wrong. If we pass existin
g
    filename with -o option it will override existing file.
    
    This patch fixes above mentioned issue by validating input parameter
    passed to snap command.

    Adds support for physical ethernet devices so that the HMCs end-to-end
    virtual device view can show SR-IOV VFs. Moves common virtual and physical
